# Networking Labs

Hands-on networking configurations, packet-level analysis, and protocol labs performed from the ground up.  
This repository documents real-world, command-level networking work — Routing, Switching, Subnetting, DHCP, DNS, ARP, VLANs, NAT, and practical Linux networking tools.

## Structure (Will be added as labs progress)

- Day01-Basic-Network-Scanning/
- Day02-ARP-and-MAC-Analysis/
- Day03-Subnetting-and-VLSM/
- Day04-DHCP-and-DNS/
- Day05-VLANs-and-Trunking/
- Day06-Routing-Static-and-Dynamic/
- Day07-NAT-and-Port-Forwarding/
- Day08-Wireshark-Protocol-Labs/
- Day09-Linux-Network-Tools/

## Goal
Build a complete, professional-grade networking portfolio that demonstrates practical ability in:

- Network configuration  
- Packet analysis  
- Linux network troubleshooting  
- Core CCNA-level skills  
- Real protocol behavior (ARP, ICMP, DHCP, DNS, TCP, UDP)

More labs will be added daily.
